            <h2 class="subtitle">Plastic - The History</h2>
            
            <p>
                Plastic was first created by Alexander Parkes who demonstrated a material called Parkesine at the 1862 Great International Exhibition in London. In 1868, John Wesley Hyatt made celluloid, after a substance called Collodion, which was not fit to be used for the public. The first fully synthetic plastic, however, was made in New York in 1907 by Leo Baekland, as he was also the one who made the term, "plastics." This plastic was called, Bakelite.

            <h2 class="subtitle">Plastic's Usage, and Why It Is Bad</h2>
            
            <p>
                Plastics contain harmful chemicals like bisphenol-A (BPA) that can seep into our food and water, posing health risks. These chemicals have been linked to hormonal imbalances and cancer. Plastics are also difficult to decompose, causing a build-up of waste that damages ecosystems. Marine animals often mistake plastic for food, leading to ingestion and entanglement, which can be deadly. Additionally, pla   stic in the ocean breaks down into tiny particles that enter the food chain, affecting not only marine life but also terrestrial and aerial animals.

            <h2 class="subtitle">Ways That Plastic Pollution Has Been Minimizing the Effect of Plastic</h2>
            
            <p>
                We will go over how boiling water can be used to clean microplastics out of water, how Plastic Fischer cleans up rivers, how Waste Sorting facilities adapt to AI, and how community waste management systems can clean up plastic.

            <h3 class="subsubtitle">Boiling Water</h3>
            
            <p>
                Boiling water is a cheap way that people use to extract microplastics out of water. When you raise water to high temperatures, plastics may clump together, while still being small, it can be more easily filtered out. First you boil the wate to high temperatures, the 150-350*, then when you filtering it through a mesh filter, most microplastics will no longer be in the water. This method, is very promising, but a lot of scientists are still researching more into it for a cheap way to extract microplastics out of water.

            <h3 class="subsubtitle">Plastic Collection Systems</h3>
            
            <p>
            Plastic Fischer is a company that invented plastic collection systems for rivers. They have recently deployed these plastic catchers in the Citrarum River in Bali and all over the world. The Ocean Cleanup is a non-profit organization that uses machines called, "Interceptors." The Interceptor Original is a high-tech solution that has been deployed in  Indonesia, Malaysia, the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, USA (California), and Thailand. The Interceptor Barrier is another solution, which, looks like a wall that sorrounds the mouth of a river in a U shape to stop any flow of plastics while allowing water to pass. The Interceptor Barrier and Interceptor Tender work hand in hand, as the Interceptor Tender, as the Tender scoops up plastics and dumps it into a dumpster onshore. These are only the machines used to clean rivers, as to clean oceans, they developed artificial floating coastlines, in a U shape slowly propelled to pick up plastics and push it in a area behind the first net, then it all gets picked up in a boat to be recycled.
