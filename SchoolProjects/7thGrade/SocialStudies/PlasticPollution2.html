            <h2 class="subtitle">AI In Waste Sorting Facilities</h2>
            <p>
                Waste sorting facilities have adapted to use AI to ensure that plastics go into the correct place. 91% of plastics go into landfills, even if they can be recycled. This change can ensure that all plastics will be reused until they no longer can be with excellent accuracy, greatly helping our ecosystems and the rate of plastic waste annually. There are many companies that help fuel this, "AI Driven Waste Sorting Facilities," like Cleanrobotics and Recycleye.

            <h2 class="subtitle">Community Waste Collecting</h2>
            
            <p>
                Community waste collecting is the process when companies or organizations use incentives to influence people to help out our ecosystems by cleaning up waste. WasteBazaar is one of these companies that are using digital technology to allow people in need of a job to offer waste management services on demand, using apps. TONTOTON is similar to WasteBazaar as people can also get paid for waste management and cleanup, but instead of relying on digital technologies, you can go to one of their recycling centers and consult on how to help. Community Waste Collecting is mostly seen in areas of need that are heavily affected by poverty, like Haiti and many African countries.

            <h2 class="subtitle">So What Can We Do About Plastic Pollution?</h2>
            
            <p>
                We can form our own plastic waste management communities designated to help around our town or we could individually try and to make a difference, and being constantly aware by our actions on how this would affect everyone, not just yourself. We could also inform people about the issues of plastic pollution and how we all must take action. We could also donate to many non-profit organizations or companies like the ones that have been stated before, and not only in money, but also in service.
